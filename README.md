This is a kitchen assistant which aims to make cooking more beginner friendly and seamless.

- Our key feature is gesture controlled video playback for those who can't touch their phone with dirty hands, but missed a part of the video or need to pause it for whatever reason. Using Machine Learning we detect gestures and map them to different controls for video playback.
- Another feature we have is automatic Pantry detection. Take a photo and instantly see what you have and how it relates to the recipe you want to cook.
- Automatic shopping cart. Using features such as the pantry detection and automatic transcription parsing. The app can read transcripts of youtube cooking videos and provide you with ingredients and steps before even having to watch the video! On top of that populate a shopping list for you making your next trip much easier.
